This directory contains BDD tests where some significant part of the
system is mocked.  They are separated from the main acceptance tests
so that mocked steps don't interfere with steps set up for the real
environment.

The mocking is used primarily for external interface definition
verification - in other words the scripts should be run with
appropriate environment variables set.
